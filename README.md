# Steroid-Sci
Sci monitors the network load by geographical location and controls distribution of transaction load to achieve the highest TPS where needed at any given time. This is achieved by controlling how many nodes in a certain geographical area are Sc5, and how many are Sgeo. 
If heavy load is detected in a certain area, Sci will issue a randomization command with certain criteria to be met. 
Sci also monitors and records on it's own internal blockchain all transaction load events by area, time, period of year etc, and is able to adjust it's load prediction by area or period, and take action accordingly. 
This achieves smoother hashrate distribution and protection against network congestion (DDoS Attack resistant).
